The Smart Party (TSP) is an audio game of questions and answers developed by Jkrweb and Andi Software during the year 2019, being later released on the Github platform under the GNU General Public License in its version 2.0.

Thanks to a simple system of questions preloaded internally within the program, {this can run anywhere as it does not require any Internet connection or installation. Soon changes will be made to it so that it can be updated automatically.

GAME PLAY

In order to start the game, the following steps must be followed within the program: 

1. If this is the first time you run the program, you will have to wait approximately one second until the program generates the configuration file. Once this is done, press the command alt+L and adjust the language of preference.

2. Once the language has been selected, it is recommended to modify the other options according to the user's taste.  When everything is set up correctly, you must exit and enter the program for the changes to be saved.

3. Again on the main screen, we can start the game in two different ways that are: 

* Using the command alt+P, which will start it directly.
* Pressing the command alt+M and pressing the option "Play".
